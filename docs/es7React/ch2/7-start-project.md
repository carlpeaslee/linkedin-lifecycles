*Starting Project*

Alright, lets see if we can put some of the skills we learned to use and get some of project set up.

First we will create a utils file. This is going to be our kind of catchall file for the various helper functions and variables we'll need to reference in our project.

I'm going to declare a const called shakespeareApi and set it equal to the end point I created for this project.

Then I'm going to spin up a random number generator function because I know I'm going to need one for when I go to get a random quote from my shakespeareApi.

Next I'm going to start on the function that I'll use to get get a random story -- but I'll hold off on its functionality –– this will be more as a place holder.
