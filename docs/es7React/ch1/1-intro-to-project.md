*intro to project*

I find its always easiest to pick up new skills when I get to put them to use on a project. So, to help get us some practice with cool new syntax we're going to learn, we are going to implement them in a fun project I've been working  on.

In my free time I like to do some creative writing in addition to writing code. Ever since I began programming, I've been drawn to aesthetically unique way that interactive development editors –– like Atom or Sublime Text highlight the different parts of a scripts syntax.

So in this project, we're going to be building our own ide of sorts that will allow use to create our own language and syntax styling rules and then apply those to our own work –– or a random work online.

Let's check out the finished product so that we can see what we're working towards .
