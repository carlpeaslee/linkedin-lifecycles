*Compiling and Support*

As I mentioned in the previous video, for the most part, we're going to be focusing on syntax and language that's been included in ecmascript2016 –– unfortunately, not all browsers support the newest features so, to make sure our website can run in any browser –– and so that we can use a few cool features that aren't even in es2016 yet, we're going to compile our code.

There are a number of automation programs that you can use to transform your code from cool es6 to traditional javascript but we're going to be using the combination of babel and webpack that ship with create-react-app.

As we check out new features, I'll do my best to keep you informed about their compatability.

Let's get started with our project by taking peek at the contents of our project.
