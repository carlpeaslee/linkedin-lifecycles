*Overview*
Hello, in this course we will be digging in to some of the newest javascript syntax.

Before we begin, lets go over something that a lot of people find confusing.

Why do people keep saying es6, es7, but then what's ecmascript 2016 -- aren't we writing javascript?

So what is it? Well, most of that is right.

The language we're writing is still called javascript. But you should know that the governing organization which releases the standardized specifications for javascript is called the European Computer Manufactuerers Association -- or ECMA. And they're the ones who are in charge of telling all the programmers and people who make browsers what is and isn't really javascript.

Now, javascript was originally written back in 1997 and since then, ECMA has been updated 7 different times -- and each of those editions has been known as es1, es2, all the way to es6 which –– actually, the people at ecma decided to later rename es2015 with the hope that new editions would be released yearly and that those editions would be identified by their year.

In this course we are going to be reviewing a number of the specifications that were added in es2015 because that was a fairly sizable update –– and it included many of the iconic updates like const and let and the arrow function and because it is largely what people think of when they think of es-whatever.

But we are also going to review some syntax that was in es2016 and even some syntax that isn't in any ecma specification yet but that can be transpiled using the same programs that we'll be using in our project –– and may well be in the upcoming es2017
